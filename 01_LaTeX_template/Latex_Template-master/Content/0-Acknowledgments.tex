\section*{Acknowledgement}
Foremost, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisor Mr. Yongzhou Zhang, for offering me the chance to write my master thesis in the Intelligent Process Automation and Robotics Lab in Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics. His supportive guidance and advice to my master thesis motivated me and I learned a lot from him. 

Further, I would like to thank Prof. Hein and Prof. Furmans for offering me the mentoring privilege in both IPR and  IFL, KIT. 

At last, I appreciate all the encouragement and support from my friends and family, without them I would not have so much courage and confidence to arrive where I am standing today.
